  We are dec0ders, a team of college students who are passionate about technology, cybersecurity and hacking. 🔐 We love exploring the latest trends and innovations in artificial intelligence, generative AI, large language models, app development, web development, startups, finance, programming languages and more. 🚀 We believe that learning by doing is the best way to master these skills, so we participate in hackathons and CTFs (capture the flag hacking competitions) where we challenge ourselves to solve real-world problems using our creativity and technical expertise. 🏆
<br/>
We started this blog to share what we are learning on topics like programming, networking, cryptography, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, blockchain, cloud computing, data science and more. 🖥️📡 Our goal is not only to document our own adventures in tech, but to help other students interested in breaking into cybersecurity and ethical hacking. So whether you want to learn how we pwned the latest CTF or are looking for study hacks for your next comp sci exam, stick around! With a dash of humor and our code-cracking ambition, we are always ready for the next adventure. 😉 Let’s get hacking! 🚩
